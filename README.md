# **Analytics 1: Predictive Analytics - Predictive Analytics using R programming**

### Consist of codes on Data Cleaning (e.g to balance imbalance data when we are interested in rare cases) and model building such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Classification and Regression Tree.


Team Challenge 2: 
  - A project to determine factors that affect whether a person has health insurance or not. In this project, Logistic Regression and Classification and Regression Tree is used to predict a binary outcome (have health insurance or not). The two models are then compared and their respective predictive accuracy are displayed through a confusion matrix. In the data, majority have health insurance and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was used with cross-validation to balance the data.
  - Packages used:
    - caret
    - data.table
    - rpart
    - rpart.plot
    - missForest
    - DMwR
  - Data: health_ins_cust.csv
